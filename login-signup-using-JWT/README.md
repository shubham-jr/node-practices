# login-signup-using-JWT
<p>
Authentication is very sensitive part of any application.
So, nowadays many types of authentication methods are available. like sessions ,JWT,OAuth etc. So, we are going to use jsonwebtoken here. Jwt is more preferred than sessions beacuse it is only present on client side not take any space on server side, and also their are many benifits also
