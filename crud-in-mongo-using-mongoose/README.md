There are many methods in HTTP like GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,COPY,HEAD,OPTIONS,LINK,UNLINK,PURGE,LOCK,UNLOCK,PROPFIND,VIEW etc.<br>
Here, we are going to perform GET,POST,PATCH and DELETE.<br>
Firstly, you have to download the code. then download node_modules by writting "npm i"(without ""), after that to start the project write node index.js, enjooyyyyyy.<br>
Note: In normal browser's you can only do GET request, so, for remaining one's you have to download a browser which gives you the facality to request all type of HTTP methods.<br>
